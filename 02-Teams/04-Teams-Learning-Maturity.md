<!-- 2.1.1 Developing Soft Skills -->

<!-- 5.2.1. Process adaptation
A common mistake is to imagine that there is a single process that can fit all projects & situations; even a good process becomes mismatched to the team over time.
The purpose of this LO is to show the learner how projects in different contexts need different methodologies (processes or strategies), and why it is important to adapt even within a single project. -->
