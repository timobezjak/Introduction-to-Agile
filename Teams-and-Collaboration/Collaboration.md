  * Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
  * Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
  * The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
  * Agile processes promote sustainable development.The sponsors, developers, and users should be ableto maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
  * The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
  * At regular intervals, the team reflects on howto become more effective, then tunes and adjustsits behavior accordingly.
