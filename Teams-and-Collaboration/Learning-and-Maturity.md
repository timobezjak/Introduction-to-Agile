# Team Learning and Development
## Developing Soft Skills
<!-- 2.1.1 Developing Soft Skills 
Soft skills such as attitude, community, trust and morale have traditionally been left out of team-based design. Agile brings them to the fore.
The purpose of this LO is to highlight how changing community drivers changes work outcomes. -->

<!-- 5.2.1. Process adaptation
A common mistake is to imagine that there is a single process that can fit all projects & situations; even a good process becomes mismatched to the team over time.
The purpose of this LO is to show the learner how projects in different contexts need different methodologies (processes or strategies), and why it is important to adapt even within a single project. -->

<!-- 
* Process adaptation
  * Need for differing methods in differing situations, need to adapt within a project
  * Technique for mid-project reflection and adaptation of process and product
