# Motivation 

> The management of knowledge workers should be based on the assumption that 
> the corporation needs them more than they need the corporation. They know
> they can leave. They have both mobility and self-confidence. This means
> they have to be treated and managed as volunteers, in the same way as
> volunteers who work for not-for-profit organizations.
> —Peter F. Drucker, Management Rev Ed, 2008


> If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood
> and don't assign them tasks and work,
> but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.
> —Antoine de Saint-Exupery
