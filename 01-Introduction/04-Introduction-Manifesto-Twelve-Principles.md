# Twelve Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto

Additionally to the values expressed in the manifesto itself, its authors declared the following twelve principles they followed. These principles can be seen as practical applications of the values of the Agile Manifesto, and as the ground from which they stem.

## The Principles

### Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

### Welcome changing requirements, even late indevelopment. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

### Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

### Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

### Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

### The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

### Working software is the primary measure of progress.

### Agile processes promote sustainable development.The sponsors, developers, and users should be ableto maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

### Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

### Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amountof work not done--is essential.

### The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

### At regular intervals, the team reflects on howto become more effective, then tunes and adjustsits behavior accordingly.
