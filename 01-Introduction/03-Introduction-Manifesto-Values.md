## The Agile Manifesto
<!-- 1.1.2. Agile Manifesto
The 2001 Manifesto for Agile Software Development is still the anchor document for all forms of Agile development.
The purpose of this LO is to make clear what was and wasn't intended with 'Agile'. -->
The proclamation of the _Agile Manifesto_ marked a milestone in the evolution of software development practice. To this day this statement is considered to be the definition of the core of agile software development.

### Uncovering Better Ways
> We are uncovering better ways of developing
> software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:

The first, and perhaps most important part of the manifesto states, that agile development defines itself as an ongoing effort to improve on how we work. This effort doesn’t mainly consist in sitting and reflecting, but in doing: trying things, evaluating their effects and correcting measures as needed.

In what looks like a recursive statement, this introductory phrase also states another important aspect: finding better ways is done by finding better ways _and_ helping others do the same (not only to learn from us.) Thus the primary goal is clearly defined as improving the way _everybody_ does software development

### Individuals and Interactions
> Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools    

Focusing on individuals looks a lot like a platitude until one recognises that traditional process models usually aim at ensuring stability of the system by making every worker in the chain as easily replaceable as possible. By focusing on each group members strengths and preferences, agile organisations deliberately accept a degree of vulnerability and dependence from their members that would be seen as irresponsible in traditional management practice.

Likewise, focusing on interactions between these individuals instead of just telling each worker where to get and put their workpieces and to whom to report may sound odd to people used to clear-cut policies and procedures. But a development team is a complex system, and so is the company to which it belongs. We need to find ways of aligning these interactions and steering them towards a common goal.

### Working Software
> Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  

Question: The software doesn’t quite work just yet, but 87% of the function points of the project have been implemented. How much of the scope has been done?—Answer: Zero. In agile terms, working software is the measure of all progress. Until you can prove your implementation works, and until you’ve actually delivered it as a _potentially shippable_ increment of the product, it represents _zero_ business value to your customer and thus cannot be considered even halfway done.

We all know from our own experience: the last 20% take 80% of the time to finish – and another 2% take some more 50%. My own attempts at estimating how far I was into finishing whatever job have regularly failed – we all know what “I’ll join you in five minutes” means when we ask a colleague to have an after work beer with us. Turns out, the same applies to software development. Once you’re finished, you know where you stand.

### Customer Collaboration
> Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  

Contracts are a good thing. Negotiating the terms of a collaboration gives us the chance to find a common understanding of how the involved parties wish to work together and what outcome they expect. But static as they are by nature, contracts shouldn’t define the things that are bound to change several times over the duration of a collaboration. Contracts for agile projects have to leave room for adaptation of both the process and the product under construction.

The scope, implementation and priorities of a software product under development change twice a day. Agile projects are set up to deal with this kind of uncertainty in that they create maximum transparency on the current state of affairs among _all_ people involved with the project. To continuously define priorities is seen as a group effort, led by the customer or business representative.

### Responding to Change
> Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> **Responding to change** over following a plan  

Planning is indispensable, but plans are worthless[^4]. Agile development processes therefore don’t merely accept that modifications to a project will will happen. Responding to change means actively and continuously dealing with these modifications. The term “inspect and adapt” describes an approach that is applied to the development of both the product _and_ the team.

In regular intervals, teams thereby look at the current state of affairs and figure out what will be worked on next. Changes to markets, moods, budgets, organisation or any other needs are a natural part of this process. Refactoring or even undoing previous work is expected and considered to be indispensable in a learning process.

### Values
> That is, while there is value in the items on
> the right, we value the items on the left more.

The manifesto explicitly does not condemn software engineering practice as a whole. Plans, processes, tools, documentation and contracts have all proven useful in many projects. What the manifesto claims is mainly that these artifacts must support (and not get in the way of) meaningful human-to-human interaction,
