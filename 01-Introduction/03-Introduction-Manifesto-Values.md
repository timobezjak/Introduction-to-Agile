# Agile Values
Agility is an umbrella under which several project methodologies unite, each of which come with their values (e.g. [Scrum][Scrum-Values], [XP][XP-Values]). The _Manifesto for Agile Software Development_ defines a set of four core values common to all agile methodologies.

## The Agile Manifesto
<!-- 1.1.2. Agile Manifesto
The 2001 Manifesto for Agile Software Development is still the anchor document for all forms of Agile development.
The purpose of this LO is to make clear what was and wasn't intended with 'Agile'. -->
The proclamation of the _Agile Manifesto_ marked a milestone in the evolution of software development practice. To this day this statement is considered to be the definition of the core of agile software development.

### Uncovering Better Ways
> We are uncovering better ways of developing
> software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:

The first, and perhaps most important part of the manifesto states, that agile development defines itself as an ongoing effort to improve on how we work. This effort doesn’t mainly consist in sitting and reflecting, but in doing: trying things, evaluating their effects and correcting measures as needed.

In what looks like a recursive statement, this introductory phrase also states another important aspect: finding better ways is done by finding better ways _and_ helping others do the same (not only to learn from us.) Thus the primary goal is defined as improving the way _everybody_ does software development.

### Individuals and Interactions
> Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools    

Focusing on individuals looks a lot like a platitude until one recognises that traditional process models usually aim at ensuring stability of the system by making every worker in the chain as easily replaceable as possible. By focusing on each group members strengths and preferences, agile organisations deliberately accept a degree of vulnerability and dependence from their members.

Communication between these individuals must be open, honest and continuous in order to ensure a shared understanding of the product under development. It’s the team’s responsibility to define what to work on, how it must be done, and to then implement it. Agile process frameworks therefore arrange for regular synchronisation on the various levels of a project’s implementation, from pair programming with practically continuous communication all the way up to iteration planning meetings every few weeks.

Direct interactions between the members of the project ensure continuous learning of the group without the disruption of written documents or standardised procedures. There may be situations where some standardisation will be helpful or even needed though.

### Working Software
> Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  

Question: The software doesn’t quite work just yet, but 87% of the function points of the project have been implemented. How much of the scope has been done?—Answer: Zero. In agile terms, working software is the measure of all progress. Until you can prove your implementation works, and until you’ve actually delivered it as a _potentially shippable_ increment of the product, it represents _zero_ business value to your customer and thus cannot be considered even halfway done.

We all know from our own experience: the last 20% take 80% of the time to finish – and another 2% take some more 50%. My own attempts at estimating how far I was into finishing whatever job have regularly failed, even in far less complicated environments than software development – we all know what “I’ll join you in five minutes” usually means when we ask a colleague to have an after work beer with us. Turns out, the same applies to software development. Only once you’re finished, you know where you stand.

There’s a common misunderstanding that valueing working software over comprehensive documentation means we don’t need documentation. Most software systems are complicated enough to warrant at least some documentation from an architectural overview to code comments. It is the team’s responsibility to figure out, together with its stakeholders, what documentation to write.

### Customer Collaboration
> Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  

Contracts are a good thing. Negotiating the terms of a collaboration gives us the chance to find a common understanding of how the involved parties wish to work together and what outcome they expect. But static as they are by nature, contracts shouldn’t define the things that are bound to change several times over the duration of a collaboration. Contracts for agile projects have to leave room for adaptation of both the process and the product under construction.

The scope, implementation and priorities of a software product under development can change twice a day, so fixing them with a contract is the wrong thing to do. Agile projects are set up to deal with this kind of uncertainty in that teams create maximum transparency on the current state of affairs among _all_ people involved with the project. This way the team and the customer are able to continuously negotiate and define the priorities of upcoming features.

Frequent delivery of production-ready software allows the customer to verify that the results of this process meet his expectations and needs.

### Responding to Change
> Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> **Responding to change** over following a plan  

Planning is indispensable, but plans are worthless[^4]. Agile development processes therefore don’t merely accept that modifications to a project will will happen. Responding to change means actively and continuously dealing with these modifications. The term “inspect and adapt” describes an approach that is applied to the development of both the product _and_ the team.

In regular intervals, teams thereby look at the current state of affairs and figure out what will be worked on next. Changes to markets, moods, budgets, organisation or any other needs are a natural part of this process. Demonstrating working software to customers and end users further reinforces this because seeing and using it helps them understand their requirements better. Refactoring or even undoing previous work is expected and considered to be indispensable in a learning process. 

### Values
> That is, while there is value in the items on
> the right, we value the items on the left more.

The manifesto explicitly does not condemn software engineering practice as a whole. Plans, processes, tools, documentation and contracts have all proven useful in many projects. What the manifesto claims is mainly that these artifacts must support (and not get in the way of) meaningful human-to-human interaction,
