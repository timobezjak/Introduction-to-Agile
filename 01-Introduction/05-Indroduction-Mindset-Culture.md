# Agile Culture and the Agile Mindset
The Scrum Guide states that Scrum is easy to understand, but hard to implement. The same is true for other methodologies that gather under the umbrella of _Agile_. Or for chess.

## Understanding Agile
<!-- 1.2.1. Understanding the Agile mindset
Many people come to Agile looking for "the Agile process". However, while some processes and methodologies may be more supportive or common in Agile organizations than others, the mindset must come first.
The purpose of this LO is to help learners understand that Agile is a mindset. -->

It has come to most software managers’ attention that teams and projects that follow the principles of Agile produce [better results at lower cost][Standish]  compared to more rigid and hierarchical models. Replacing the exisiting process model with an “agile” one therefore looks like the natural thing to do.

Coaches even go to great lengths trying to help _translate_ between the two worlds: The product manager will take on the role of the Product Owner; the team lead will be the Scrum Master; project managers will be … well perhaps we’ll still need someone to track progress and manage resources (see [this thread][Scrum-PM] on LinkedIn). Likewise, requirements engineers will be required to write down their findings into separate documents that will from now on be called User Stories. Forecasts will be drawn from Story Point estimates, as will be progress reporting. The daily stand-up meeting will be used to report the state of affairs to the Product Owner. This is how it becomes obvious what you, as an experienced project manager, knew all along: Agile is just the same thing we did for decades with new names that make it look friendlier to generation X or Y people.

Except that it is not. Buying new running shoes will not turn you into a marathon runner. Relabeling your organisation will not make you agile.

Letting go of old habits will bring you closer to running a marathon. Acquiring new habits instead will, too. You will have to re-think _your_ values and adjust your priorities. If you refuse to do that, or if you come to the conclusion that your existing habits, values and priorities are best suited to make you happy, then your fantasy of becoming a marathon runner will go the way of the new year’s resolution.

## It’s All in Your Mind
<!-- 1.2.2. Establishing the Agile mindset
Experiencing the Agile mindset is the best way to establish it in a learner
The purpose of this LO is to have the learner experience situations in which the Agile mindset is likely to be different, so the learner can internalize the difference experientially, not just in concept.
To be acceptable, this LO should include exercises that allow the learner to experience the Agile mindset. -->

> —Woody Allen

In her [Talk at goto Aarhus][Rising-Aarhus], computer scientist and organisational change consultant Linda Rising explains the taxonomy of fixed vs. agile mindsets. According to her research[^3], while a fixed mindset focuses on getting things right, an agile mindset sees learning and continuously getting better at doing things as the yardstick of success.

Accordingly, people with a fixed mindset[^2] choose their goals so that they are achievable – after all, missing a goal will be seen as failure and therefore detrimental to their self-esteem. Their reasoning is rooted in the belief that people have traits that determine what they should work on, what they can be good at. A person with a fixed mindset therefore sees effort and learning as signs for a lack of predisposition for a topic. In other words: negatively. As these talents are seen as given, they cannot expand. Someone else’s success is therefore seen as a threat towards one’s own, which may lead to anything from obstruction to retreat.

An agile mindset, on the other hand, encourages people to choose challenging goals; missing a goal is seen as an opportunity to learn and improve. Working hard to get better is part of the game. Seeing others succeed with daring operations gives additional support to this belief and encourages further improvement. “The pie is ever-expanding!”

So what Agile is about, is how we see failure and perfection. Failing is learning. Perfection is an activity. People, processes, projects, products, organisations, are all seen as work in progress and continuously growing.

## Think Value
Traditionally, the success of a project is judged upon the trinity of Scope, Budget and Time. A project is thought to be a success if all requirements, as defined at the beginning, have been implemented on time and on budget. That’s strange, because the actual goal of every project an organisation in its right mind would initiate would be to create something of value to the organisation.

In this regard, scope, time and budget are, at best, what in Lean Startup is called _vanity metrics_ – they may correlate, but there is no causality between the three and the value generated. The problem is, that we’re not used to think in terms of value and that it’s more difficult to estimate or measure value than it is to measure weeks, dollars or numbered requirements.

Agility requires us to focus on value, and agile methodologies help us doing so. Modules and features are broken down to sizes where they can be handled effectively, and then implemented in priority order. Valuable and potentially deployable software is delivered from the very beginning of a project. So technically after the first iteration already the users could begin using the new product.

## Practice, practice, practice
<!-- 1.2.3. Agile in context
The level of knowledge and experience held by individuals, teams and organizations can affect behaviors, processes, and adoption.
The purpose of this LO is to introduce the learner to team or organizational development models, so that beginners can see where they are limited and experts can understand their colleagues' limits in applying these ideas.
To be acceptable, this LO should include discussion of shu-ha-ri, Dreyfus, or a similar novice-to-expert development model. -->
> “Can you tell me how to get to Carnegie Hall?”  
> “Practice, man, practice!”[^1]

Unlearning routines and rethinking assumptions is hard work and won’t just happen overnight. Learning a new skill is a process we all know from experience. According to a quote often cited by Malcolm Gladwell, it takes 10’000 hours of practice to gain mastery in an area. What’s more interesting though is that skills acquisition can be seen as a process with distinct, identifiable stages.

One of them is known in Switzerland as “Berufsbildung” – professional education. A majority of young Swiss enter business life as apprentices. After three to four years they take a test to become journeymen and -women. And those who decide to continue learning may choose to become, through training and practice, masters of their profession.

The model is similar to _[Shu Ha Ri][Shu-Ha-Ri]_ that was brought from Japanes martial art Aikido to our attention by Alistair Cockburn. At the Shu stage the student learns the basics of his art from a single – his – teacher. At the Ha stage, the student reflects on the underlying principles to gain a deeper understanding of the practice. At the Ri stage, the student learns from his own practice, adjusting it to his own situation.

Another often-cited model is _The Dreyfus Model of Skills Acquisition_. It separates five stages and is explained in detail in [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning][PTaL][^4]

Similarly, teams and organisations go through several stages of “maturity” or “fluency” – as Diana Larsen and James Shore name it in their paper _[Agile Fluency][AF]_ in accordance with language acquisition.
