## Establishing the Agile Mindset
<!-- 1.2.2. Establishing the Agile mindset
Experiencing the Agile mindset is the best way to establish it in a learner
The purpose of this LO is to have the learner experience situations in which the Agile mindset is likely to be different, so the learner can internalize the difference experientially, not just in concept.
To be acceptable, this LO should include exercises that allow the learner to experience the Agile mindset. -->

## Practical Agile
<!-- 1.2.3. Agile in context
The level of knowledge and experience held by individuals, teams and organizations can affect behaviors, processes, and adoption.
The purpose of this LO is to introduce the learner to team or organizational development models, so that beginners can see where they are limited and experts can understand their colleagues' limits in applying these ideas.
To be acceptable, this LO should include discussion of shu-ha-ri, Dreyfus, or a similar novice-to-expert development model. -->
