# Agile Values and Principles

## The Agile Manifesto
The proclamation of the _Agile Manifesto_ marked a milestone in the evolution of software development practice. 

> ### Manifesto for Agile Software Development
>
> We are uncovering better ways of developing
> software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools    
> **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
> **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
> **Responding to change** over following a plan  
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on
> the right, we value the items on the left more.
>
> <em>Kent Beck, Mike Beedle, Arie van Bennekum, Alistair Cockburn,

To this day these statements are considered to define the core of all agile software development. As one might have expected, this condensate is often reduced even further to the mere four comparisons (thereby violating Einstein’s golden rule that everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler).

Neglecting the value that lies in the right-hand items is a powerful tool for attacking agile initiatives or processes, in two ways: First, it delivers strong arguments why an agile process cannot work in many environments; second, if you really choose to do away with process, documentation, contracts and plans altogether, your project _will_ fail, and your agile initiative with it.

### Uncovering Better Ways
The first, and perhaps most important part of the manifesto states, that agile development defines itself as an ongoing effort to improve on how we work. This effort doesn’t mainly consist in sitting and reflecting, but in doing: trying things, evaluating their effects and correcting measures as needed.

In what looks like a recursive statement, this introductory phrase also states another important aspect: finding better ways is done by finding better ways _and_ helping others do the same (not learn from us.) Thus the primary goal is clearly defined as improving the way _everybody_ does software development, not gaining a competitive edge over people who are stuck with old practice. (Never the less it seems obvious that organisations that choose to stick with “command and control”-like management structures will gradually lose their competitive edge.)

### Individuals and Interactions
> “The 21st century is the age of complexity. It is the century where
> managers realize that, to manage social complexity, they need to
> understand how things grow. Not how they are built.”
> —<em>Jurgen Appelo, Management 3.0</em>

Focusing on individuals looks a lot like a platitude until one recognises that traditional process models usually aim at ensuring stability of the system by making every worker in the chain as easily replaceable as possible. By focusing on each group members strengths and preferences, agile organisations deliberately accept a degree of vulnerability and dependence from their members that would be seen as irresponsible in traditional management practice.

Likewise, focusing on interactions between these individuals instead of just telling each worker where to get and put their workpieces and to whom to report may sound odd to people used to clear-cut policies and procedures. But a development team is a complex system, and so is the company to which it belongs. We need to find ways of aligning these interactions and steering them towards a common goal.

### Working Software
Question: The software doesn’t quite work just yet, but 87% of the function points of the project have been implemented. How much of the scope has been done?—Answer: Zero. In agile terms, working software is the measure of all progress. Until you can prove your implementation works, and until you’ve actually delivered it as a _potentially shippable_ increment of the product, it represents _zero_ business value to your customer and thus cannot be considered even halfway done.

We all know from our own experience: the last 20% take 80% of the time to finish – and another 2% take some more 50%. My own attempts at estimating how far I was into finishing whatever job have regularly failed – we all know what “I’ll join you in five minutes” means when we ask a colleague to have an after work beer with us. Turns out, the same applies to software development. Once you’re finished, you know where you stand.

### Customer Collaboration
Contracts are a good thing. Negotiating the terms of a collaboration gives us the chance to find a common understanding of how the involved parties wish to work together and what outcome they expect. But static as they are by nature, contracts shouldn’t define the things that are bound to change several times over the duration of a collaboration. Contracts for agile projects have to leave room for adaptation of both the process and the product under construction.

The scope, implementation and priorities of a software product under development change twice a day. Agile projects are set up to deal with this kind of uncertainty in that they create maximum transparency on the current state of affairs among _all_ people involved with the project. To continuously define priorities is seen as a group effort, led by the customer or business representative.

### Responding to Change
Planning is indispensable, but plans are worthless[^4]. Agile development processes therefore don’t merely accept that modifications to a project will will happen. Responding to change means actively and continuously dealing with these modifications. The term “inspect and adapt” describes an approach that is applied to the development of both the product _and_ the team.

In regular intervals, teams thereby look at the current state of affairs and figure out what will be worked on next. Changes to markets, moods, budgets, organisation or any other needs are a natural part of this process. Refactoring or even undoing previous work is expected and considered to be indispensable in a learning process.
