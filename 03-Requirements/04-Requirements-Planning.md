# Planning
<!-- 5.1.1 Planning
A misconception of Agile development is that it involves no planning and no promises.
The purpose of this LO is to give learners a view of different planning stages and timeframes, separating release-level planning from daily & task-level planning. To be acceptable, this LO should include examples of project chartering, release planning, and iteration planning. -->
