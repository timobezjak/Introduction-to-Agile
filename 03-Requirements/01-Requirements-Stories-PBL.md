# The Product Backlog
<!-- 3.1.2. Value‐based work
Many people, even understanding the idea of incremental development, can't see how to break work into small, value-centered work items, and track their progress.
The purpose of this LO is to develop and practice techniques for breaking problems into value-based work, and tracking progress against them. -->
<!-- 4.1.1. Defining the customer
The literature and common usage can be confusing in defining the customer.
The purpose of this LO is to clarify customer-side roles and how they are referred to in Agile methods, particularly sponsor, buyer, and user, and relating them to actual people who need to be satisfied by the project and product. -->
