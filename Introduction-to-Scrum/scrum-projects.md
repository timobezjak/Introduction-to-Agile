# The Scrum Project Environment

## The Product Vision

## The Definition of Done
Quality expectations can vary wildly between Scrum projects. They depend on several factors, like strategic priority of the project, the client’s or the team’s guidelines and abilities, regulatory needs etc. Also, quality is a versatile term – its use can easily lead to misunderstandings.

To avoid this, the Scrum Team needs to create a shared understanding and to clearly define which criteria need to be met in order for a Product Backlog Item to be _done_. The document containing this definition is called the _Definition of Done_. All implementations must meet the standards defined therein.
