# The Scrum Process

![The Scrum Double Loops][double-loops]
The Scrum process is simple to understand, yet difficult to implement. It defines a few roles, events and artifacts, as shown below, and its basic working is usually explained using the double loops illustration displayed above. The full, authoritative definition of Scrum is contained in a small booklet, the [Scrum Guide], which is available for download on the internet. It is regularly revised and updated by its maintainers, the inventors of Scrum, Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber.

## Sprint (Without Haste)
What the illustration fundamentally shows is the transformation of user needs into a new version of a product under development. The basic unit of this transformation is called a _Sprint_ in Scrum terminology, or an iteration in more general terms. Each Sprint is a _mini project_ that takes one to four weeks, with a preference for the shorter time scale, and is immediately followed by another Sprint throughout the project until it finishes.

This means that the team must not be exhausted at the end of a Sprint, which makes the term somewhat misleading. A Scrum project must be managed in such way that everyone involved keeps working at a _sustainable pace_, i. e. under a work load that would, in theory, allow the project to go on forever.

## Events
Agile software development is fundamentally about communication between all parties involved with the creation of a new product. Scrum prescribes a number of time-boxed events. They help create transparency and shared understanding between team members. The Sprint is the “big” event that encompasses all the others as described below.

### Sprint Planning
Each Sprint begins with a Sprint Planning event during which the Scrum Team agrees on the work for the sprint. It therefore has to answer two questions: What will be done, and how will it be done.

Considering the current project state, the Scrum Team identifies what should be worked on next. Starting after a few Sprints, the team will be able to tell with some confidence how much work may fit into the available capacity. Pulling from the Product Backlog (see below) and any remaining work from the previous Sprint, they compile a set of items to work on. They should all support a common objective for the sprint that can be expressed in a statement of one or two sentences, the _Sprint Goal_.

In the second part of the Sprint Planning, the Development Team defines _how_ it plans to achieve the Sprint Goal. What are the tasks? What do we have to learn? Which work items will we pair up for? At the end of the second part, the Development Team declares their readiness to go for the Sprint Goal. Any trouble that has the potential to block the Development Team from reaching the Sprint Goal needs to be communicated and resolved with the Product Owner and Scrum Master immediately.

After the Sprint Planning, the Sprint is scope and goal are immutable. Even if at some point during the Sprint the Product Owner feels some of it has become obsolete, it cannot be changed. The Sprint can, however, be cancelled at any moment, at the Product Owner’s discretion. It is an extreme measure that generally has to be avoided.
