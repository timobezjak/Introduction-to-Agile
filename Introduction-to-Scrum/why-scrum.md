# Why Scrum?
For more than twenty years now, the Standish Group has been monitoring the success and failure of software development projects. What it boils down to is, that agile projects are three times more likely to fully succeed, and at a three times lower risk of failing completely than those run by traditional software engineering practices, as shows the following chart by [Mike Cohn].

This certainly doesn’t mean that adopting agile practice will end all your software project troubles. But in many interpretations this means: Your most promising way to success will lead through Agile.

## Complexity
A [system][video-system] is a group of elements whose interactions define the whole. This means, it is impossible to add or remove a part without changing the properties of the system itself. A _complex system_ is one in which the elements (or agents) interact in ways, than can be explained only in hindsight. But it is not possible to _predict_ interactions based on prior knowledge. _Complex adaptive systems_ continuously change their behaviour over time in order to self-optimise.

The development of innovative software is one example for complex systems. Test-driven development and other practices focus on bringing down dependencies (or “coupling”) to a manageable amount. Still, adding of modifying functionality often affects the overall system behaviour in unexpected ways. Perhaps more importantly though, it usually affects its _users’_ behavioiur in unexpected ways.

Groups of humans are a prime example for complex adaptive systems. It has been observed long before, that adding more people to a late project will make it later. However, any other change to a team, its environment, or its rules can have unpredictable consequences, good or bad, while the team adapts to the new reality, effectively re-calibrating itself.
