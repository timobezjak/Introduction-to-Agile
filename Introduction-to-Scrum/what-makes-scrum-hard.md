# What Makes Scrum So Hard

> At the end of every sprint, the same procedure would pass off: The Product Owner accepted most of the stories, confirmed that the sprint goal had been reached, and praised the team for their effective cooperation and productive delivery. Two days later he wanted to meet and discuss the problems we had: that the team delivered too slowly, too low quality, too costly.

## Simple to Understand – Difficult to Master
Setting up a Scrum project is simple. After reading the 16 pages [Scrum Guide], you’re good to go. And yet, one of the first things that document states is this: Scrum is _lightweight, simple to understand, and difficult to master_. Explaining the roles, events, and artifacts that define a Scrum project is done in minutes. Understanding how to make effective use is an eternal journey.

## Minimal Viable Framework
Scrum as a framework is effectively little more than a minimal set of instructions for running any project: You need somebody who knows _what_ to build, and a team that knows _how_ to do that. Have them meet regularly and deliver usable product increments in short cycles. Someone needs to make sure communication flows smoothly. It’s so logical, it almost seems obvious.

## Self-Organisation
Part of the power of this simple set of rules comes from making it clear that these few people are the ones responsible for delivering the project – with no-one else allowed to interfere. Does this mean they know everything about it and don’t need to talk to anyone else? Obviously not. What it means is that everyone who wants to have a say on what is going to be built, will have to play with them team, meet with the team frequently, and communicate by the means defined by the team.

## Zombie Attack!
Any attempt to work around these rules will therefore jeopardise the success of the Scrum team. For organisations that are not used to thinking with an agile mindset, this can be challenging – in other words: for most organisations that at some point decided to _adopt_ Scrum. The Product Owner’s boss gives him another project to manage; the sponsor wants progress reports; a stakeholder escalates to upper management because their priorities aren’t properly reflected in the development. Capacity projections are taken for guarantees; and a manager requires the _resource_ who’s going on holidays for three weeks to be _replaced_ by someone else.

It’s classical project management, and it has been proven [not to work for software][DeMarco] teams. But in case of doubt we naturally tend to fall back to behaviour we’re familiar with. It’s the Scrum team’s hardest job to fully involve their stakeholders. The people who hire a development team sometimes bet high on its success. They need to know how things are going, and they want their needs and ideas heard.

## Changing Culture
Adopting agility means leaving traditional project management methodology for good. Mixing both will cause endless pain while barring you from the benefits of either approach. For the culture of an organisation to change takes time, sometimes a lot of time. Making it possible is a science in its own right, so change to support agility won’t come by itself. This is something to be aware of from the beginning.

## If It Doesn’t Work, Apply More of It
When your Product Owner seems to act in inexplicable ways as described above, changing her mind whenever she talks to a higher-paid opinion: Blame yourself, and make sure everyone is properly involved in decision processes.
