<!-- 3.2.1 Work-in-progress (WIP)
Work-in-progress (WIP), a term from lean manufacturing, seems to many people a strange concept to introduce outside of manufacturing, but WIP shows up in incremental development.
The purpose of this LO is to describe work-in-progress (WIP), demonstrate how it maps to design work, to incremental development, to multi-specialist and multi-department teams, where it hides on a design project, and why it is useful to track and reduce WIP. -->
<!-- 4.1.3 User feedback 
The learner will need a method for engaging users and sponsors mid-project.
The purpose of this LO is to provide the learner with one or more technique for soliciting feedback from users and sponsors. -->
<!-- 5.2.2. Project adaptation
Reflection workshops are necessary for both product and process adjustment. Techniques for conducting reflection workshops are best learned experientially.
The purpose of this LO is to give learners practice in project introspection & reflection. -->
