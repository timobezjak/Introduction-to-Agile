# Working Software

## Stability
> Quality: The totality of features and characteristics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs. (ISO 8402: 1986, 3.1)[^1]

(Stable software implies a stable project)

## Cost and Benefit
> “Quality in a product or service is not what the supplier puts in. It is what the customer gets out and is willing to pay for.” —Peter F. Drucker

## Keeping Quality High
> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

<!-- 3.1.3. Retaining quality
It is easy to lose sight of the cost of rework in incremental-iterative development.
The purpose of this LO is to introduce and highlight why Agile developers need to keep an eye on design quality even (or especially) when working incrementally and iteratively. -->
<!-- 3.2.2. Continuous integration
Continuous integration is a valuable goal in software development; non-software projects can still use the more general concepts of frequent integration.
The purpose of this LO is to introduce the concepts of early, frequent, and continuous integration, and to link them to project effectiveness. -->
<!-- 3.2.3. Continuous delivery
Continuous delivery is frequently confused with continuous integration. However, continuous delivery is tied to business rules that take into account a wide range of business decisions, such as marketing, customer support and training.
The purpose of this LO is to define the differences between continuous integration and continuous delivery, and to help the learner understand how continuous delivery can affect broader business operations. -->

<!-- * Working software
  * Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
  * Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
  * Working software is the primary measure of progress.
  * Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
  * Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amountof work not done–is essential.
-->

<!-- * Responding to change
  * Welcome changing requirements, even late indevelopment. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
  * Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
  * Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amountof work not done–is essential.
