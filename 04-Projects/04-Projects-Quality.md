# Working Software
<!-- 3.1.3. Retaining quality
It is easy to lose sight of the cost of rework in incremental-iterative development.
The purpose of this LO is to introduce and highlight why Agile developers need to keep an eye on design quality even (or especially) when working incrementally and iteratively. -->
<!-- 3.2.2. Continuous integration
Continuous integration is a valuable goal in software development; non-software projects can still use the more general concepts of frequent integration.
The purpose of this LO is to introduce the concepts of early, frequent, and continuous integration, and to link them to project effectiveness. -->
<!-- 3.2.3. Continuous delivery
Continuous delivery is frequently confused with continuous integration. However, continuous delivery is tied to business rules that take into account a wide range of business decisions, such as marketing, customer support and training.
The purpose of this LO is to define the differences between continuous integration and continuous delivery, and to help the learner understand how continuous delivery can affect broader business operations. -->
<!-- 3.2.4. Cost & benefit of frequent delivery
Delivering is not merely giving a demo; it includes costs as well as benefits.
The purpose of this LO is to discuss the benefits, difficulties and costs of delivering frequently. -->
