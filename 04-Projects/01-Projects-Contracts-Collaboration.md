# Contracts and Customer Collaboration

## Customer Collaboration: Preparing the Ground

### Trust

### Understanding the Goal

### Understanding Value
> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

(Cost–Time–Scope(–Quality) vs. Value; maximising the amount of work not done)

## The Customer
<!-- 4.1.1. Defining the customer
The literature and common usage can be confusing in defining the customer.
The purpose of this LO is to clarify customer-side roles and how they are referred to in Agile methods, particularly sponsor, buyer, and user, and relating them to actual people who need to be satisfied by the project and product. -->

   * Including customers and users
   * 
      * Who is the "customer"? Difference between sponsor, buyer, user
      * Product/project success correlates with end-user involvement

Value over Cost/Time/Scope (success in traditional PM, according to Standish: “Completed on time, on budget, with all features and functions as originally specified.”; success in Agile: maximum value delivered *and* maximised work not done)
