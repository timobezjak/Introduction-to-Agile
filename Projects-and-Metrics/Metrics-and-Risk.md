# Metrics and Risks

## Controlling the End Result


## Promise!


## Frequent Delivery
> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

<!-- 3.2.4. Cost & benefit of frequent delivery
Delivering is not merely giving a demo; it includes costs as well as benefits.
The purpose of this LO is to discuss the benefits, difficulties and costs of delivering frequently. -->


## Change


## How Far Are We?
<!-- 5.1.3. Status
A team and its sponsors need to know where it is in its work.
The purpose of this LO is to give the learner at least one technique to track and show the status of the project and the team. -->

## Missing the Goal


<!-- * Working software
* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
* Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amountof work not done–is essential.

<!-- * Responding to change
* Welcome changing requirements, even late indevelopment. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
* Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amountof work not done–is essential.

<!--
* Incremental development
* 
  * Incremental development & staged delivery: what they are, their value, the difference to effort-based development
  * Importance of retaining design quality when doing incremental/iterative
  * Technique for breaking assignments into small value-based pieces & tracking them
* Work-in-progress (WIP)
* 
  * What is WIP, where does it hide, how WIP shows up in incremental development
  * Continuous integration, continuous delivery as general goals
