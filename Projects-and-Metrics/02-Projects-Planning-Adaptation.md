# Planning – and Responding to Change

## Business Agility
> Welcome changing requirements, even late indevelopment. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

## Inventory
<!-- 3.2.1 Work-in-progress (WIP)
Work-in-progress (WIP), a term from lean manufacturing, seems to many people a strange concept to introduce outside of manufacturing, but WIP shows up in incremental development.
The purpose of this LO is to describe work-in-progress (WIP), demonstrate how it maps to design work, to incremental development, to multi-specialist and multi-department teams, where it hides on a design project, and why it is useful to track and reduce WIP. -->

### Backlog

### Technical Debt
> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

### Unused Functionality
> Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amountof work not done—is essential.

## Lead Time


## Collecting Feedback
<!-- 4.1.2 User involvement
Product/project success correlates with end-user involvement. Many teams face resistance to getting end-users to participate in a project, which then can fail even if the team practiced every other Agile habit besides getting feedback from real users.
The purpose of this LO is to convey the importance of end-user involvement within as well as at the end of iterations. -->
<!-- 4.1.3 User feedback 
The learner will need a method for engaging users and sponsors mid-project.
The purpose of this LO is to provide the learner with one or more technique for soliciting feedback from users and sponsors. -->
(From all _customer_ groups)


## Process Improvement


## Project Planning
<!-- 5.2.2. Project adaptation
Reflection workshops are necessary for both product and process adjustment. Techniques for conducting reflection workshops are best learned experientially.
The purpose of this LO is to give learners practice in project introspection & reflection. -->
